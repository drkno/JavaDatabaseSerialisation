Project to make serialization method to serialize Java objects into SQL statements.

All relevant classes are in src/database/, other classes are from fitterizer (https://bitbucket.org/thagodsquad/nikefit) and are for testing.

This project is in a mostly working but abandoned state. Released under the MIT license in the hope that it will be useful to someone someday.
