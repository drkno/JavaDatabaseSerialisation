Project to make serialization method to serialize Java objects into SQL statements.

All relevant classes are in src/database/, other classes are from fitterizer (https://bitbucket.org/thagodsquad/nikefit) and are for testing.

Supposts table creation, insertion and updating. Primary and foreign keys are not yet implemented but should be relatively simple to implement provided familiarity with the code base. The project was written quickly so a bit of refactoring might be required.

This project is in a mostly working but abandoned state. Released under the MIT license in the hope that it will be useful to someone someday.
